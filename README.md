# ZPlanner v1.4.0

ZPlanner is a command-line tool developed to assist in project planning and management, with a special focus on software development projects. The project was born from the need to have a simple yet powerful tool that would allow project management directly from the terminal, without the need for complex graphical interfaces.

One of ZPlanner's main differentiators is its ability to function as a memory system for AI-assisted development in IDEs with prompt capabilities. By maintaining a structured and hierarchical project record, ZPlanner helps preserve development context, allowing AI assistants to better understand the project's structure, history, and current state, resulting in more accurate and contextualized suggestions and assistance.
